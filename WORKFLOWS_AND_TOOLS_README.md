## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd GhostWire-secure-mesh-communication

# Run the quick start script
./scripts/quick_start.sh
```

### 2. Activate Development Environment

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Or use the alias
ghostwire-dev
```

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run basic tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run comprehensive test suite
python scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.py

# Or use the alias
ghostwire-test
```

### 4. Security Checks

```bash
# Run security monitoring
./scripts/security_monitor.sh

# Run enterprise security monitor
./scripts/enterprise_security_monitor.sh

# Generate security report
python scripts/generate_security_report.py

# Or use the alias
ghostwire-security
```

### 5. Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Lint code
flake8 .
mypy ghostwire/

# Run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start development session
ghostwire-dev

# 2. Make code changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Run tests
ghostwire-test

# 4. Check security
ghostwire-security

# 5. Commit changes (pre-commit hooks run automatically)
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Add new functionality"
```

### Security Monitoring

```bash
# Set up daily security monitoring
./scripts/setup_security_cron.sh

# Run manual security check
./scripts/security_monitor.sh

# Generate detailed security report
python scripts/generate_security_report.py
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflows automatically run on:

- **Push to main/master**: Full pipeline with production deployment
- **Push to develop**: Full pipeline with staging deployment
- **Pull Requests**: Full testing and security checks
- **Scheduled**: Daily testing, weekly security scans

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Pre-commit Hooks Fail

```bash
# Update pre-commit hooks
pre-commit autoupdate

# Run manually to see detailed errors
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### 2. Safety Checks Fail

```bash
# Check Safety installation
safety --version

# Reinstall if needed
pip install --upgrade safety

# Run with verbose output
safety check --verbose
```

#### 3. Tests Fail

```bash
# Check dependencies
pip list

# Reinstall test dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest pytest-cov black isort flake8 mypy

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v --tb=long
```

#### 4. Docker Issues

```bash
# Check Docker status
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Test Docker Compose
docker-compose config

# Restart Docker service if needed
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Look in `logs/` directory for detailed error logs
2. **Review reports**: Check `reports/` and `security_reports/` directories
3. **GitHub Actions**: Check workflow runs in the Actions tab
4. **Script help**: Most scripts have `--help` or `-h` options
