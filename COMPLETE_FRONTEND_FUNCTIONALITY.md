## 🎯 **Dynamic Behavior Examples**

### **Before (Static):**
- Buttons just sat there doing nothing
- "Scan Network" was just a label
- "Connect All" didn't actually connect
- "Broadcast" was just a button
- "Security Scan" was just text
- "Lockdown" was just a button

### **After (Dynamic):**
- **Scan Network** → Actually scans network → Finds real peers → Updates UI
- **Connect All** → Connects to all peers → Shows progress → Updates peer count
- **Broadcast** → Prompts for message → Sends to all peers → Shows delivery status
- **Security Scan** → Runs real scan → Shows threat count → Updates security alerts
- **Lockdown** → Activates emergency mode → Shows critical alert → Locks system
- **Rotate Keys** → Calls backend API → Rotates keys → Shows success message
- **Firewall Test** → Tests firewall → Shows pass/fail results → Updates status
- **System Restart** → Confirms action → Restarts system → Shows progress
