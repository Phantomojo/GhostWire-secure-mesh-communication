## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive documentation suite
- Security policy and code of conduct
- Development roadmap and changelog
- MIT License

### Changed
- Refactored `TransportRegistry` to use `Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<dyn Transport>>` for async, mutable access to all transports.
- Updated all code to lock the mutex before calling mutating methods on transports.
- Fixed architectural issue where `send_message` required `&mut self` but registry used `Arc<dyn Transport>`, which only allowed immutable access.
- Updated TCP transport instantiation in mesh networking to use the correct libp2p provider and config for compatibility with libp2p 0.44.0.
- All build errors related to transport mutability, trait bounds, and libp2p provider types are resolved. Project builds cleanly.
- Updated project structure and organization
- Enhanced documentation and guides
