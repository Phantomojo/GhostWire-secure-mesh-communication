# GhostWire\n\nGhostWire is a secure, decentralized platform for threat intelligence sharing and private messaging, designed for cybersecurity professionals and trusted teams. It combines encrypted, anonymous messaging with peer-to-peer sharing of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in a privacy-first, metadata-free environment.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Encrypted, Anonymous Messaging**\n  End-to-end encrypted, ephemeral messaging between trusted peers using the Double Ratchet algorithm and Noise Protocol for forward secrecy.\n\n- **Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Networking**\n  Built on libp2p for decentralized peer discovery, NAT traversal, and secure message routing without any central authority.\n\n- **Threat Intelligence Sharing**\n  Secure sharing and retrieval of IOCs (malicious IPs, hashes, domains) with peer signing and reputation-based trust.\n\n- **Zero Metadata Storage**\n  No phone numbers, usernames, or IP logs are stored. All data is ephemeral or user-controlled.\n\n- **CLI-First, Cross-Platform**\n  Command-line interface designed for Linux, macOS, and Windows, with future plans for web-based GUI.\n\n- **Optional Anonymization**\n  Integration with Tor and I2P for stealth deployments and enhanced privacy.\n\n---\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `core/`\n  Core modules including networking, encryption, metadata sanitization, and storage.\n\n- `cli/`\n  Command-line interface commands and logic.\n\n- `messaging/`\n  Messaging module implementing encrypted, ephemeral communication.\n\n- `ioc/`\n  IOC sharing module for secure threat intelligence exchange.\n\n- `trust/`\n  Peer trust and reputation management system.\n\n- `tor_integration/`\n  Optional Tor/I2P anonymization layers.\n\n---\n\n## CLI Commands\n\n- `whisper <recipient> <message>`\n  Send an encrypted, ephemeral message to one or more peers.\n\n- `cloak --enable|--disable`\n  Enable or disable Tor/I2P anonymization layers.\n\n- `drop <ioc-file>`\n  Share threat intelligence (IOCs) with trusted peers.\n\n- `fetch --category <IP/hash/domain> --reputation <high/low>`\n  Retrieve IOCs from peers based on filters.\n\n- `peers --list|--status`\n  Manage and view peer connections and statuses.\n\n- `trust --view <peer-id>|--update <peer-id> --score <score>`\n  View or update peer trust scores.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Core Networking Layer\n\n- Uses libp2p for decentralized peer discovery, NAT traversal, and message routing.\n- Supports mDNS for local peer discovery and RequestResponse protocol for message exchange.\n- Handles peer connections and event processing asynchronously.\n\n### Encryption Engine\n\n- Built on libsodium (sodiumoxide crate) for cryptographic primitives.\n- Implements symmetric encryption with secretbox, message signing, and verification.\n- Supports forward secrecy and secure key management.\n\n### Messaging Module\n\n- Supports asynchronous encrypted messaging with offline queueing.\n- Implements one-to-one and group messaging with ephemeral messages.\n- Integrates encryption and networking layers for secure communication.\n\n### IOC Sharing Module\n\n- Shares encrypted IOC bundles in JSON format.\n- Supports fetching by category, reputation, and peer source.\n- Signs and verifies IOCs to establish trustworthiness.\n\n### Peer Trust System\n\n- Maintains reputation scores based on message quality and feedback.\n- Allows whitelisting and blacklisting of peers.\n- Supports challenge-response and key fingerprint exchange.\n\n### Tor/I2P Integration\n\n- Enables running GhostWire over Tor or I2P networks.\n- Uses bridges or hidden services for persistent identities.\n- Enhances privacy and metadata sanitization.\n\n---\n\n## Development and Contribution\n\n- Written in Rust for performance, safety, and cross-platform compatibility.\n- Uses async programming with Tokio for concurrency.\n- Modular design for ease of extension and maintenance.\n- Comprehensive error handling and logging.\n- Unit and integration tests for core modules.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **Build the project:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cargo build --release\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the CLI:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cargo run -- whisper <recipient-peer-id> "Your message here"\n   ```\n\n3. **Explore other commands:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cargo run -- --help\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Future Work\n\n- Complete implementation of all CLI commands.\n- Develop web-based GUI for enhanced usability.\n- Integrate full Tor/I2P support.\n- Implement advanced peer trust and reputation algorithms.\n- Add offline message queuing and replay.\n- Enhance testing and continuous integration.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\n---\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions, contributions, or support, please open an issue or pull request on the GitHub repository.\n
