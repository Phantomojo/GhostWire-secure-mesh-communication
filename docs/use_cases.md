# GhostWire Use Cases

## Disaster Relief
- Mesh comms in collapsed infrastructure (earthquake, hurricane)
- Store-and-forward for asynchronous delivery
- Fallback to LoRa/Bluetooth in disaster mode

## Activism & Censorship Resistance
- Secure, anonymous comms in hostile regions
- Peer discovery with Sybil defense
- Traffic obfuscation to resist surveillance

## Rural/Remote Mesh
- Bridge isolated communities (LoRa, WiFi, drones)
- Store-and-forward for intermittent links
- Local reputation and federation for trust

## Example Scenarios
- Protest organizers use QR code key exchange for secure onboarding
- Field teams auto-switch to LoRa when WiFi fails
- Rural mesh relays bridge villages with store-and-forward
