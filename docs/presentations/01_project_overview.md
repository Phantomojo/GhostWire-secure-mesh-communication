## 1. What is GhostWire?

GhostWire lets people connect and communicate directly, forming a mesh network using whatever technology is available: Bluetooth, WiFi, LoRa, WebRTC, or even standard internet. It bridges different protocols (like Briar, Meshtastic, Matrix) and puts privacy and security first.

- **For non-technical readers:** Think of GhostWire as a walkie-talkie for the digital age, but smarter and more private. You can send messages, share files, and connect with others—even if the internet is blocked or down.
- **For technical readers:** GhostWire is a modular, extensible platform built in Rust and TypeScript, supporting pluggable transports, protocol adapters, and advanced security modules.

## 2. Why Mesh Networking?

- **Resilience:** Mesh networks don’t rely on a single server or internet connection. If one device goes down, others keep the network alive.
- **Privacy:** No central authority means less risk of surveillance or censorship.
- **Flexibility:** Works with many technologies—Bluetooth, WiFi, LoRa, and more.

## 3. Real-World Scenarios

### Activists in Censored Regions
- **Problem:** Internet blackouts and surveillance.
- **Solution:** GhostWire forms a local mesh, letting activists communicate securely and privately.

### Disaster Response
- **Problem:** Infrastructure is down after a natural disaster.
- **Solution:** First responders use GhostWire to coordinate rescue efforts, even without cell towers.

### Rural Communities
- **Problem:** No reliable internet access.
- **Solution:** GhostWire connects villages using LoRa and WiFi, enabling messaging and information sharing.

### Community Events
- **Problem:** Overloaded networks at large gatherings.
- **Solution:** Attendees use GhostWire to share updates and stay connected.

## 4. Key Features & Benefits

- **Decentralized:** No single point of failure.
- **Privacy-First:** End-to-end encryption, metadata protection, and traffic obfuscation.
- **Modular:** Add or remove transports and adapters as needed.
- **Cross-Protocol:** Bridge to Briar, Meshtastic, Matrix, and more.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple web and mobile interfaces.
- **Open Source:** Transparent, auditable, and community-driven.

## 5. How GhostWire Works (Plain & Technical)

### Plain-Language Overview
- Devices connect directly to each other, forming a web (mesh).
- Messages hop from device to device until they reach their destination.
- No internet? No problem—use Bluetooth, WiFi, or LoRa.
- Everything is encrypted and private.

### Technical Deep Dive
- **Core:** Rust backend with modular traits for transports, adapters, and security.
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript web UI, CLI for power users.
- **Transports:** Pluggable modules for Bluetooth, WiFi, LoRa, WebRTC, TCP/IP.
- **Adapters:** Protocol bridges for Briar, Meshtastic, Matrix, etc.
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption (AES-256-GCM, X25519), Sybil defense, quotas, blacklists, traffic obfuscation.
- **Store & Forward:** Messages are cached and relayed when possible.

## 7. Best Practices & Anti-Patterns

### Best Practices
- Use multiple transports for resilience.
- Keep software updated for latest security patches.
- Use strong, unique passwords for device access.
- Educate users about privacy and security features.

### Anti-Patterns
- Relying on a single transport (e.g., only WiFi).
- Disabling encryption or security modules.
- Ignoring software updates.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is GhostWire legal to use?**
A: In most countries, yes—but always check local laws, especially regarding encryption and radio use.

**Q: Can I use GhostWire without the internet?**
A: Yes! That’s one of its main features.

**Q: How secure is GhostWire?**
A: It uses state-of-the-art encryption and privacy techniques, but no system is 100% secure. Follow best practices.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Absolutely! See the Contributing chapter.
