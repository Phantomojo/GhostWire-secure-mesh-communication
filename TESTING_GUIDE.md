# 🚀 GhostWire Final Testing Guide

## 🎯 **What's New - REAL FUNCTIONALITY**

Your GhostWire system now has **ACTUAL** peer-to-peer communication instead of fake data:

### ✅ **Real Features Implemented:**
- **Real Peer Discovery** - Actually finds other GhostWire instances on your network
- **Real Connection Management** - Connect/disconnect buttons actually work
- **Real Messaging** - Messages are sent through the backend API
- **Real Data** - No more fake "10 connections" - shows actual peer count
- **Real-time Updates** - Refreshes real data every 5 seconds
- **Connection Requests** - Send/accept/reject actual connection requests

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### 1. **Single PC Test**
```bash
./launch-ghostwire-final.sh
```

### 2. **Cross-PC Test (2 Computers)**
1. Run the launcher on both PCs
2. Note the IP addresses shown
3. On PC 2, click the ⚙️ config button
4. Set backend URL to PC 1's IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3001/api`)
5. Click Connect
6. Use "Scan Network" to discover each other
7. Click "Connect" on discovered peers

## 🔍 **Testing Checklist**

### **Backend Functionality**
- [ ] Backend starts without CLI errors
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Network scanning finds peers
- [ ] Connection requests work
- [ ] Real peer data is returned

### **Frontend Functionality**
- [ ] UI loads without errors
- [ ] Real data is displayed (not fake)
- [ ] Connect buttons work
- [ ] Scan Network finds peers
- [ ] Messages can be sent
- [ ] Status updates in real-time

### **Cross-PC Communication**
- [ ] PCs can discover each other
- [ ] Connection requests are sent/received
- [ ] Peers can accept/reject connections
- [ ] Connected peers can message each other
- [ ] Real-time status updates work

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Backend Won't Start**
- Check if ports 3001/3002 are available
- Ensure Rust is installed: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- Try: `cd ghostwire && cargo build --bin ghostwire --features web`

### **Frontend Won't Load**
- Check if ports 5173/5175 are available
- Ensure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Try: `cd webui && npm install && npm run dev`

### **Peers Can't Connect**
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure both PCs are on same network
- Verify IP addresses are correct
- Check backend URLs in config

### **No Peers Found**
- Ensure both GhostWire instances are running
- Check network connectivity
- Try manual IP configuration
- Verify backend ports are accessible

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### **Before Connection:**
- Network panel shows 0 connected peers
- Scan Network finds other GhostWire instances
- Connect buttons are available on discovered peers

### **After Connection:**
- Network panel shows actual connected peer count
- Connected peers appear in the topology
- Messaging becomes available
- Real-time status updates

### **Real Data Indicators:**
- Connection count matches actual peers
- No fake "Node-Alpha", "Node-Beta" names
- Real IP addresses shown
- Actual timestamps and status

## 🔧 **Advanced Testing**

### **Multiple PC Test (3+ Computers)**
1. Start GhostWire on all PCs
2. Use one as "hub" - others connect to it
3. Test mesh networking
4. Verify all can communicate

### **Network Stress Test**
1. Connect multiple peers
2. Send many messages simultaneously
3. Test connection stability
4. Monitor performance

### **Security Test**
1. Try connecting from unauthorized PCs
2. Test message encryption
3. Verify connection validation
4. Check error handling

## 📝 **Bug Reporting**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the console** for error messages
2. **Note the exact steps** that caused the issue
3. **Include system info**: OS, Node.js version, Rust version
4. **Screenshot the error** if possible
5. **Test on different PCs** to isolate the issue

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ No more fake data in the UI
- ✅ Real peer connections are established
- ✅ Messages actually send between PCs
- ✅ Network scanning finds real peers
- ✅ Connection requests work properly
- ✅ Real-time updates show actual status

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

Run `./launch-ghostwire-final.sh` and start testing the real peer-to-peer communication!
