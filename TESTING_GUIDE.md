# üöÄ GhostWire Final Testing Guide

## üéØ **What's New - REAL FUNCTIONALITY + PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

Your GhostWire system now has **ACTUAL** peer-to-peer communication instead of fake data, plus **small-scale production deployment capabilities**:

### ‚úÖ **Real Features Implemented:**
- **Real Peer Discovery** - Actually finds other GhostWire instances on your network
- **Real Connection Management** - Connect/disconnect buttons actually work
- **Real Messaging** - Messages are sent through the backend API
- **Real Data** - No more fake "10 connections" - shows actual peer count
- **Real-time Updates** - Refreshes real data every 5 seconds
- **Connection Requests** - Send/accept/reject actual connection requests
- **All 46 Buttons Functional** - Every button in every panel works
- **Production Deployment** - Docker containerized with monitoring

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Production Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Deploy for small-scale production
./deploy.sh

# Access GhostWire
# Web UI: http://localhost:3000
# API: http://localhost:9000
```

### **Option 2: Development Mode**
```bash
# For development and testing
./launch-ghostwire-working.sh
```

### **Option 3: System Service**
```bash
# Install as system service
sudo ./systemd/install-service.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Production Deployment Issues**

#### **Docker Container Won't Start**
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Check container logs
docker-compose logs ghostwire

# Check port availability
sudo lsof -i :3000
sudo lsof -i :9000

# Restart container
docker-compose restart
```

#### **Health Check Failures**
```bash
# Run health check manually
./monitoring/health-check.sh

# Check container health
docker ps
docker inspect ghostwire | grep -A 10 "Health"

# Check API endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

#### **Resource Issues**
```bash
# Check resource usage
docker stats ghostwire

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory usage
free -h
```

### **Development Mode Issues**

#### **Backend Won't Start**
- Check if ports 3001/3002 are available
- Ensure Rust is installed: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- Try: `cd ghostwire && cargo build --bin ghostwire --features web`

#### **Frontend Won't Load**
- Check if ports 5173/5175 are available
- Ensure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Try: `cd webui && npm install && npm run dev`

### **Network Issues**

#### **Peers Can't Connect**
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure both PCs are on same network
- Verify IP addresses are correct
- Check backend URLs in config

#### **No Peers Found**
- Ensure both GhostWire instances are running
- Check network connectivity
- Try manual IP configuration
- Verify backend ports are accessible

## üìä **Expected Behavior**

### **Production Deployment:**
- Container starts and shows "healthy" status
- Web UI accessible at http://localhost:3000
- API responds to health checks
- Logs are generated in /app/data/logs/
- Resource usage stays within limits

### **Before Connection:**
- Network panel shows 0 connected peers
- Scan Network finds other GhostWire instances
- Connect buttons are available on discovered peers
- All 46 buttons respond to clicks

### **After Connection:**
- Network panel shows actual connected peer count
- Connected peers appear in the topology
- Messaging becomes available
- Real-time status updates

### **Real Data Indicators:**
- Connection count matches actual peers
- No fake "Node-Alpha", "Node-Beta" names
- Real IP addresses shown
- Actual timestamps and status

## üîß **Advanced Testing**

### **Production Load Testing**
```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/status
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/peers
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/broadcast -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"test"}'

# Test health monitoring
./monitoring/health-check.sh

# Test resource limits
docker stats ghostwire --no-stream
```

### **Multiple PC Test (3+ Computers)**
1. Deploy GhostWire on all PCs using `./deploy.sh`
2. Note the IP addresses of each instance
3. Configure cross-PC communication
4. Test peer discovery across all instances
5. Test messaging between all connected peers
6. Verify real-time updates work across all instances

### **System Service Testing**
```bash
# Install as system service
sudo ./systemd/install-service.sh

# Test service management
sudo systemctl status ghostwire
sudo systemctl restart ghostwire
sudo systemctl stop ghostwire
sudo systemctl start ghostwire

# Check service logs
sudo journalctl -u ghostwire -f
```
